# Welcome to QR-Generator!! 

### Time to complete : 1 day
### Team Members : 3


## Summary 

This is our own custom spinning QR-code generator. The spinning element makes it much more fun to use than other QR code generators and the custom elements we wanted to build into it would have made it great for marketing in business cards and online channels. 

## Liked

For one day I felt like we achieved a lot. We got along really well as a team and had fun making it. I also really liked that we gave the site a slight USP by playing with CSS animations to have the QR code rotate. And yes it still works!

## Learnt

We got to learn about JSON body to post RESTful fetch requests to an API and then used the response from the request to populate the page. I learnt that we should spend at least half the allocated time planning instead of racing into doing the first idea that we agreed on. 

## Lacked 

The number one thing I felt lacking in this project was a sense of purpose- there are many QR generators out there and ours doesn't offer anything particularly different aside from a unique UX.

## Longed For

I think we should have spent more time planning the project idea to come up with something more creative instead of settling on the first project idea that we all agreed to do. Other weeks when we spent half the day iterating ideas it seemed that we made a more useful end product. 


I hope you enjoy using the site!
